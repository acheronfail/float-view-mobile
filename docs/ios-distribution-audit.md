# iOS distribution audit

This is the reusable implementation inventory and submission checklist. Brief
build-linked outcomes are in [the release verification summary](../openspec/changes/prepare-public-distribution/verification.md).
Detailed execution history and device results belong in ignored local records;
successful packaging is not Apple processing or physical beta acceptance.

## Privacy and network inventory

| Surface | Implementation and treatment |
| --- | --- |
| Bluetooth and telemetry | Native CoreBluetooth communicates with the selected VESC. Saved board identity, settings, tunes and recordings are stored by the shared Rust service in app-private SQLite files. No developer telemetry endpoint, advertising or analytics SDK is configured. |
| Route recording | Optional CoreLocation observations are recorded during rides. `CoreLocationAdapter` uses Always permission for recording that may restart with riding while locked/backgrounded; denying location does not prevent ordinary BLE telemetry. |
| Maps | Leaflet requests `https://tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png` for viewed recorded routes, up to zoom 19. Tiles can identify precise viewed areas; IP address, user-agent and HTTP metadata reach OSMF. The raw route/telemetry record is not uploaded. |
| Speech | AVSpeechSynthesizer speaks locally generated ride phrases; there is no microphone capture or speech-recognition upload. Platform voice downloads remain platform services. |
| Live Activity | ActivityKit local content updates, without push tokens, remote updates or a server. The extension reads only the supplied activity state. |
| Web frontend | Bundled single-file HTML talks to authenticated loopback HTTP/WebSocket endpoints. This communication remains on the same device. Only theme/accent hints are held in localStorage; product data belongs to Rust. |
| Imports/exports | User-selected imports are staged in private storage before Rust reads them. User-selected exports may contain precise route data. Shared-file copies and platform backups have separate lifetimes. |
| Support/TestFlight | Support links open public GitHub Issues. Apple provides TestFlight crash/usage/feedback information separately from app-initiated collection; the privacy policy explains this. A feedback email is still needed in App Store Connect, even when public support uses Issues. |

The public policy is [PRIVACY.md](../PRIVACY.md), linked from README and shared
Settings. Public console URL:
`https://github.com/acheronfail/float-view-mobile/blob/master/PRIVACY.md`.
Support URL: `https://github.com/acheronfail/float-view-mobile/issues`.
Check both URLs anonymously before submission.

Do not answer “Data Not Collected” solely because there is no developer server.
The app manifest conservatively declares precise location and other data (IP and
HTTP request metadata) for map functionality, linked and not used for tracking.
This accounts for the tile provider's retained IP/request logs without promising
anonymity. Review the matching App Privacy answers in the console before release;
there are no advertising/tracking domains and no ATT request is needed for the
audited functionality. Purely on-device board/ride records are not listed as
off-device collection. Support and TestFlight disclosures remain explicit.

OSMF requires visible attribution, application identification, normal HTTP cache
behavior and no bulk/offline tile downloads. The existing map retains visible
attribution and uses normal WebKit HTTP caching; the iOS user-agent now includes
FloatView/version. No prefetch/offline feature or cache-bypass headers exist.
Check actual provider headers/cache behavior on an iOS device before completing
the map-service checkpoint. OSMF offers no availability guarantee. Sources:

## Required-reason APIs and manifests

The host app's `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` covers its Swift code and statically linked
Rust/SQLite implementation. There are no external Swift packages or embedded
third-party binary SDK frameworks. The frontend bundles Svelte/Leaflet; dev tools
and research vendor submodules are not copied into the app. Rust dependencies
come from the locked Cargo graph, including rusqlite/libsqlite3-sys and standard
library filesystem/time implementations.

| Category | Reason | Actual use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SystemBootTime | `35F9.1` | SharedService timer deadlines/ordering, permission timeouts, speech cooldowns, ActivityKit update duration and Rust Instant timers. Exported timings are elapsed between app events, rather than raw system boot times. |
| DiskSpace | `E174.1` | SharedService checks available capacity; shared policy prevents recording/maintenance writes when space is insufficient. Raw available-byte facts stay inside the local runtime. |
| FileTimestamp | `C617.1` | Rust/SQLite stat/fstat/lstat and app-private schema-cache metadata/eviction, staging and file bounds. User imports are copied into private staging before Rust reads them. |

The separate Live Activity extension has its own manifest with no collection,
tracking or app-authored required-reason API calls. It renders supplied ActivityKit
content, including SwiftUI timer views; it does not link the Rust service or host
adapters. No direct UserDefaults or active-keyboard API use was found. Web
localStorage is not NSUserDefaults. Do not add speculative reasons for APIs that
the app does not use. The archive/export validator requires both packaged
manifests to match the reviewed source manifests.

[manifest packaging guidance](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/adding-a-privacy-manifest-to-your-app-or-third-party-sdk),
[collection categories](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/app-privacy-configuration/nsprivacycollecteddatatypes/nsprivacycollecteddatatype).
Before submission, validate both packaged manifests and inspect Xcode Organizer's
aggregate Privacy Report from the candidate archive. Check collection categories,
purposes, linkage and tracking against the inventory above. Resolve any Apple
processing findings; local inspection alone does not establish acceptance.

## Permissions, background execution and encryption

- `bluetooth-central` supports active BLE telemetry/reconnection while backgrounded.
- `location` supports the optional route recording described above. Usage strings
  distinguish foreground and background recording. Always permission is requested
  through an explicit user recovery flow, not merely at app launch.
- `audio` supports user-enabled spoken ride announcements with an audio session;
  it is not a silent-audio keepalive. There is no microphone/recording declaration.
- NSSupportsLiveActivities is enabled; frequent remote updates, push notification,
  App Group and iCloud capabilities are not requested.
- Release WebViews no longer enable Safari inspection. Fixture adapters and
  performance/reset hooks remain behind build conditions. Mac launch overrides
  still need their separately tracked production-configuration work.

The iOS Info.plist declares `ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption=false`: this app uses
platform HTTPS for maps, platform Bluetooth security and standard hashes (SHA-1
for WebSocket handshakes, SHA-256 for schema/content identity), with no custom
data-encryption implementation or bundled TLS stack in the locked iOS graph.
This declares no **non-exempt** encryption, rather than claiming HTTPS uses none.
Re-audit whenever dependencies/networking change and answer any applicable
territory-specific questions in App Store Connect. Source:

## Gates still open before TestFlight

Use the build-linked verification summary for completed checks. Before upload,
verify the exact candidate rather than reusing evidence from an earlier binary.

- Baseline 100 and software preservation/startup checks are implemented; complete
  the scoped device/container and failure/retry presentation checkpoint before
  inviting external users. See [storage-baseline.md](storage-baseline.md) and the
  verification summary.
- The [iOS package/source audit](ios-package-source-audit.md) verified exact
  public source and existing packaged texts, and fixed missing Rust runtime
  notices. Validate the corrected texts in the fresh tagged candidate before
  upload. Build 77 predates the fix. The owner's official Apple permission is
  recorded in licensing.md; third-party terms remain independent.
- When upload is authorized, create a fresh signed CI candidate and validate
  Apple processing and encryption status. Local and read-only checks do not
  establish transport or processing acceptance.
- Fill beta description, feedback email, what-to-test notes and any required beta
  review contact privately in App Store Connect. First tester is the owner;
  invited external users come later and need the applicable external beta review.
- Provide real supported-hardware pairing/use instructions and review evidence;
  test the delivered build's BLE, optional route permissions/background capture,
  announcements, Live Activity, import/export and restart on the affected device.

## TestFlight information worksheet

Draft copy for the first iOS beta. The owner enters private contact details in
App Store Connect; they must not be committed here. No console field is marked
complete merely because its proposed text appears below.

### Where to enter the private fields

In App Store Connect, choose Apps → Float View → TestFlight → Additional →
Test Information. Select the language and enter Feedback Email. Under the
TestFlight App Review information section, enter the reviewer contact name,
phone and email privately. This app has no sign-in account, so do not invent
reviewer credentials. Save the changes. Feedback Email is available to testers
and used as the reply-to for invitations; choose an address you are willing to
share with them. Public support can remain GitHub Issues.

### Beta App Description

Float View connects over Bluetooth to compatible VESC-based boards to display
live telemetry, record rides and review session history. Optional route recording,
spoken ride announcements and Live Activities support ride tracking. No account
is required. This beta requires compatible hardware for live features; recorded
sessions and the open-source licence information can be reviewed separately.

Float View is open source. Source code, build instructions and public support
are available at https://github.com/acheronfail/float-view-mobile.

### What to Test

Check Bluetooth discovery, connection and reconnection with your supported board.
Confirm live readings, session creation and history after restarting the app.
Try location recording both off and on, including a short locked-screen ride.
Check spoken announcements, Live Activity updates and session export/import.
Verify the new licences page opens from Settings and returns correctly.

Report the app version/build, iPhone model, iOS version, controller/firmware
versions, what you expected, what happened and reproduction steps. Remove precise
routes and private identifiers before posting public GitHub Issues; TestFlight
feedback is also available. Use the app only when it is safe to do so.

### Review Notes

No sign-in is required. Live telemetry needs a compatible VESC controller and
Bluetooth connection. The audited controller firmware families are VESC 6.02,
6.05, 6.06 and 7.00; exact board/Refloat/transport details for the physical review
example must be supplied from the accepted device test, not assumed from this
source inventory. This app is not a controller firmware installer.

After accepting the first-launch safety notice, enable Bluetooth access, select
the supported device on Connect and open its live view. Settings explains
optional location access and announcement controls. Background Bluetooth is used
for ongoing ride telemetry/reconnection, location for user-enabled route capture,
and audio for spoken announcements. Live Activities use local updates, not push.

History can be reviewed without hardware by importing an existing .floatview
archive: Sessions → Session actions → Import session, then choose the file.
The repository's public synthetic baseline recording is available for this
purpose; its location is fictional and it contains no user's ride data:
https://github.com/acheronfail/float-view-mobile/raw/master/backends/fixtures/public-baseline/100/recording.floatview

Before external beta review, the owner must add the tested hardware connection
steps and a reviewer-accessible physical-device/hardware interaction video.
The synthetic archive demonstrates history only, not real Bluetooth integration.
Do not submit these notes while those specific review inputs are missing.

### URLs and declarations

- Privacy policy: https://github.com/acheronfail/float-view-mobile/blob/master/PRIVACY.md
- Support: https://github.com/acheronfail/float-view-mobile/issues
- No app account, advertising, analytics SDK, tracking domains or ATT prompt.
- App Privacy draft follows the audit above: map-provider precise location and
  request metadata for app functionality, linked, no tracking. The owner must
  review/save the console answers; an embedded manifest does not fill them in.
- The reviewed encryption declaration is embedded in Info.plist. Resolve any
  Apple processing questions on the actual uploaded build.

## Device acceptance procedure

Record the tested build and results locally, following the recording policy in
the verification summary.

Install over the existing app using the same AltStore signing identity; do not
uninstall first. A different identity/container cannot establish an old-data
upgrade. If old data is already at baseline 100, preservation is expected and
must not be mistaken for a failed reset. Export any recordings you want to keep
before updating, since recognised pre-baseline development data is disposable.

In the local result record, include iPhone model, iOS version, installed display
version/native build and supported board/controller/Refloat/transport versions.
Check:

1. Recognised old development data resets once; OS grants remain accurate.
2. Create a new saved board/settings change and session. Relaunch twice and
   confirm new data remains. Also check process restart, not just foregrounding.
3. Connect/reconnect the real board; test Bluetooth denial/recovery if it is
   practical without disrupting other work.
4. Enable optional route capture through Settings, check denial/recovery, record
   briefly while locked/backgrounded, and confirm timestamps/map route on return.
5. Check announcements and Live Activity during that same scoped session.
6. Export/import a recording; keep the exported copy outside the app container.
7. Open Settings → View licences and notices, scroll and return to Settings.
8. Open privacy, support and source links in the system browser; return and
   confirm Settings remains usable and the embedded app has not navigated away.

This is a focused regression checkpoint for the storage baseline, permission
state and real iOS background/Bluetooth integration. Simulator checks establish
synthetic storage handling and UI behavior, but cannot establish real radio,
location, announcements or lock-screen behavior. Do not create unsafe riding
conditions just to test; a short controlled session is enough. Record the actual
native build number from the tested nightly. This sideload check does not
establish TestFlight signing, delivery or production entitlement behavior.

Failure/retry presentation is exercised separately on an isolated simulator with
synthetic unsupported data; do not alter real databases to provoke that failure.
Store-delivered permissions/background behavior still needs a TestFlight pass
once the first upload is processed.

## Package identity

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| App / extension | `fail.acheron.floatview` / `fail.acheron.floatview.live-activity` |
| Minimum iOS/iPadOS | 17 |

Validate the publishing team, current public certificate fingerprints and profile
expiry against the signed candidate. Keep the operational signer inventory and
credential provisioning history local; private signing material stays outside Git.
