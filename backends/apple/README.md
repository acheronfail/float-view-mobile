# Apple host

Swift owns Apple OS integration for the shared Rust backend. One `SharedService`
creates the process owner in a private application-support root, protected until
first unlock on iOS. Its bounded executor maps Bluetooth/location callbacks,
executes timers and permission requests, and supplies native theme and file UI.
It contains no product storage, configuration policy, reconnect policy, domain
dispatch or snapshot reconstruction.

`LoopbackServer` borrows that owner through the existing C binding. Native hosts
supply HTML and start/stop the listener; Rust owns the complete authenticated
frontend contract. iOS WebViews and listeners can be replaced independently of
recording. Export presentation acknowledges dismissal or completed destination
copy before releasing the shared file lease.

Source ownership:

| Path                                    | Responsibility                                                  |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Sources/FloatViewBackend/application/` | Process composition and bounded OS exchange                     |
| `Sources/FloatViewBackend/bluetooth/`   | CoreBluetooth, GATT setup, permissions and test adapter         |
| `Sources/FloatViewBackend/location/`    | Core Location acquisition                                       |
| `Sources/FloatViewBackend/transport/`   | Listener lifetime and caller-owned C buffers                    |
| `Sources/FloatViewBackend/protocol/`    | Software-conformance fixture only                               |
| `ios/float-view/`                       | iOS lifecycle, native file presentation, appearance and WebView |
| `macos/`                                | macOS lifecycle, native file presentation and WebView/window    |

SQLite schemas and archive validation are embedded in Rust. Native file import
uses WebKit's scoped file input and the authenticated streaming importer.
Addresses, tokens, private identity and raw telemetry stay out of normal logs.

`just test apple` covers OS adapters, C bounds and shared-service conformance.
`just apple-packaging` checks clean macOS, iOS simulator and iOS device packages.
Choose the affected tests and packages using the root
[verification policy](../../AGENTS.md#verification). Physical BLE/background and
presentation checks need connected hardware only when the changed behavior
cannot be established in software; unrelated platforms need no regression run.

## AltStore installation

Run `just ipa` on macOS to build the frontend and iOS device app in Debug, as
`just run ios <device>` does, and package
`FloatView-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.ipa` in the directory where you invoke `just`, using
the current local date and time. No connected device or Xcode signing
account is required: AltStore signs the IPA when installing it. The archive omits
macOS metadata files that can confuse AltStore's app detection.

Transfer the IPA to Files on the iPhone and select it in AltStore's My Apps tab
using the + button. If switching from a `just run ios` installation fails, export
any recordings you want to keep, then remove that installation before retrying.
Install future IPA updates through AltStore and use AltStore to refresh them.
