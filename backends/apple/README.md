# Apple host

Swift owns Apple OS integration for the shared Rust backend. One `SharedService`
creates the process owner in a private application-support root, protected until
first unlock on iOS. Its bounded executor maps Bluetooth/location callbacks,
executes timers and permission requests, and supplies native theme and file UI.
It contains no product storage, configuration policy, reconnect policy, domain
dispatch or snapshot reconstruction.

`LoopbackServer` borrows that owner through the existing C binding. Native hosts
supply HTML and start/stop the listener; Rust owns the complete authenticated
frontend contract. iOS WebViews and listeners can be replaced independently of
recording. Export presentation acknowledges dismissal or completed destination
copy before releasing the shared file lease.

Source ownership:

| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Sources/FloatViewBackend/application/` | Process composition and bounded OS exchange                     |
| `Sources/FloatViewBackend/bluetooth/`   | CoreBluetooth, GATT setup, permissions and test adapter         |
| `Sources/FloatViewBackend/location/`    | Core Location acquisition                                       |
| `Sources/FloatViewBackend/transport/`   | Listener lifetime and caller-owned C buffers                    |
| `Sources/FloatViewBackend/protocol/`    | Software-conformance fixture only                               |
| `ios/float-view/`                       | iOS lifecycle, native file presentation, appearance and WebView |
| `macos/`                                | macOS lifecycle, native file presentation and WebView/window    |

SQLite schemas and archive validation are embedded in Rust. Native file import
uses WebKit's scoped file input and the authenticated streaming importer.
Addresses, tokens, private identity and raw telemetry stay out of normal logs.

`just test apple` covers OS adapters, C bounds and shared-service conformance.
`just apple-packaging` checks clean macOS, iOS simulator and iOS device packages.
Physical BLE/background and presentation checks use the connected hardware.
