## 1. Candidate Boundary

- [ ] 1.1 Add a locked safe `backends/core/refloat-configuration-service` workspace crate that depends only on `refloat-configuration-codec` and exposes bounded platform-neutral facts, events, effects, snapshots, identities, and stable payload-free errors.
- [ ] 1.2 Implement the audited release catalogue, legacy patch resolution, connection begin/reset, cache admission decisions, and bounded schema-page assembly through the existing codec.
- [ ] 1.3 Implement current/default reads, monotonic revisions, flywheel policy, operation and generation matching, write encoding, acknowledgement-to-readback sequencing, normalization, conflicts, aborts, and failure recovery.

## 2. Candidate Evidence

- [ ] 2.1 Add source-derived fixture tests for every audited release, legacy resolution, cache hit/miss/corruption, exact schema paging, and direct/CAN opaque route identity.
- [ ] 2.2 Replay the complete selected Swift and Kotlin service transition vectors, including reads, defaults, write verification, flywheel transitions, reconnect/reset, revisions, snapshots, effects, and native-equivalent failures.
- [ ] 2.3 Add adversarial tests for stale or malformed generations, operations, routes, indexes, commands, chunks, offsets, lengths, acknowledgements, failures, aborts, ordering, counter wrap, bounds, determinism, and payload-safe diagnostics.

## 3. Ownership And Isolation

- [ ] 3.1 Document the new candidate boundary and later deletion path in core ownership guidance without changing the frontend contract, persistent formats, or production owners.
- [ ] 3.2 Extend workspace, dependency, source-selection, bridge-catalogue, symbol, generated-artifact, package-input, and safety audits to prove the candidate is locked, safe, codec-only, and absent from every production package and call path.

## 4. Software Verification

- [ ] 4.1 Run focused candidate tests, locked formatting, warnings-denied linting, dependency/ownership audits, strict change validation, and repository diff checks.
- [ ] 4.2 Run `just verify` and all packaging checks with the isolated candidate present, resolving every non-physical regression.

## 5. Physical Regression

- [ ] 5.1 Run the complete applicable Android ESP32 matrix on the connected device and verify every non-location assertion.
- [ ] 5.2 Run the complete applicable iOS ESP32 matrix on the connected device and verify every non-location assertion, deferring only bounded location-sample acquisition when necessary.
- [ ] 5.3 Run the complete applicable macOS ESP32 matrix on the host and verify every assertion.
- [ ] 5.4 Record the physical evidence, rerun final focused and complete software checks, and leave the candidate unselected for separate host-cutover changes.
