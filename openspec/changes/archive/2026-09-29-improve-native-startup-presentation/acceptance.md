# Startup presentation acceptance summary

Implementation: [fae10ebb](https://github.com/acheronfail/float-view-mobile/commit/fae10ebbddf1201f68acdd0659d1744d8269b180).

Scoped iOS/Android cold-launch and foreground appearance/lifecycle checks passed,
including system/app theme combinations and Android WebView reconstruction.
Browser/native software and packaging checks passed. The candidate removed the
observed intermediate Android document flash; no calibrated speedup is claimed.

Manual macOS, broader device matrices and unavailable renderer/bind/navigation
fault injection were excluded, not passed. No BLE checkpoint was required for
this appearance change. Detailed recordings, timings, device inventory and
execution history are retained locally under `.local/physical-testing/`.
