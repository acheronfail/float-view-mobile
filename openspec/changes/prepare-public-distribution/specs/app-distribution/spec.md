# Spec Delta

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Nightlies identify development commits

Master pushes and manual master runs SHALL resolve commit-identified rolling nightly prereleases without marking them latest. Before the first stable v1.0.0 tag, nightlies SHALL target v1.0.0; afterward they SHALL use the next patch after the greatest stable ancestor. Unchanged successful commits SHALL skip ordinary nightly rebuilding; an explicit store-preparation run MAY request fresh packages for all routes with one shared native number. Failed publication SHALL remain retryable.

#### Scenario: Development after a minor release

- **WHEN** three commits follow `v0.2.0` in historical version resolution
- **THEN** the general next-patch resolver produces `v0.2.1-nightly.3.g<source-hash>` without creating a stable patch tag; current pre-v1 launch preparation applies the explicit v1.0.0 target

#### Scenario: Unchanged source or failed build

- **WHEN** the current commit already has a successfully published Nightly, or a platform build fails
- **THEN** ordinary unchanged builds are skipped unless store preparation explicitly requests a shared new run, and failures do not replace the last successful Nightly

#### Scenario: Launch preparation after old tags are removed

- **WHEN** historical pre-v1 tags have been removed and no stable v1.0.0 tag exists
- **THEN** a fresh rolling nightly is `v1.0.0-nightly.<count>.g<hash>` with defined commit-count semantics and no stable v1.0.0 tag is created

### Requirement: Publication remains bounded and recoverable

GitHub distribution SHALL publish only after all three sideload packages succeed, serialize publication, retain only the current Nightly asset set and preserve stable history. A stable rerun SHALL resume a draft or leave an already published release intact. Missing release metadata SHALL be distinguished from API or authentication failure. Store submission SHALL be independently retryable and SHALL NOT gate GitHub publication.

#### Scenario: Interrupted nightly publication

- **WHEN** uploading or publishing a new Nightly fails
- **THEN** existing successful assets are retained until replacement uploads succeed and a later run can retry

#### Scenario: Store review is delayed

- **WHEN** a store rejects, delays or fails processing a submission
- **THEN** completed GitHub downloads remain available and unaffected stores can proceed independently

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Historical development releases receive one cleanup

The approved pre-v1 cleanup SHALL remove all existing pre-v1 GitHub releases/assets and matching local/remote version tags while retaining commit history. Publication SHALL pause and active jobs SHALL drain before deletion against an enumerated cleanup manifest. The rolling nightly channel SHALL resume afterward. This exception SHALL NOT permit deletion of later stable release history.

#### Scenario: Clean historical development releases

- **WHEN** the approved cleanup runs
- **THEN** old v0.x stable and prerelease downloads and their version tags are removed, unrelated refs/commits remain intact, and a fresh preparation nightly can publish

### Requirement: Version one is reserved until acceptance

The first supported stable launch SHALL be v1.0.0. Its stable tag SHALL NOT be created or pushed until release-candidate checks pass. Preparation nightlies and store beta builds SHALL remain available before that point and SHALL NOT implicitly trigger production store release.

#### Scenario: Candidate is still under test

- **WHEN** a 1.0.0 candidate has outstanding acceptance checks
- **THEN** testing uses increasing native build identifiers without creating the stable tag or publishing production store releases

### Requirement: Sideload distribution remains available

Stable and nightly GitHub releases SHALL retain an AltStore-installable IPA, a signed Android APK and a universal macOS ZIP. Contributors SHALL retain documented local source-build commands without store-upload credentials. Store packages SHALL use the same application owners and shared frontend as corresponding sideload packages.

#### Scenario: Download without a store account

- **WHEN** a user selects a GitHub release
- **THEN** all three platform downloads have installation instructions and do not depend on an approved store listing

### Requirement: Installation guidance explains every distribution route

The README SHALL link to verified live iOS App Store, Google Play and Mac App Store listings while retaining AltStore IPA, Android APK, direct macOS and source-build instructions. It SHALL identify Float View as open source under AGPL-3.0-or-later and explain that paid app purchases support development and distribution fees. Store links SHALL appear only when their listings are available.

#### Scenario: User chooses how to install

- **WHEN** a user reads the README after all three store listings are live
- **THEN** each platform has its store link and relevant non-store installation route, with links to the source and licence and a clear explanation of purchase support

#### Scenario: One store has not launched

- **WHEN** a store listing is unavailable or still awaiting approval
- **THEN** the README retains working download instructions and does not present a placeholder or unavailable listing as an install link

### Requirement: Store publication is explicit and traceable

Store submissions SHALL use Release packages with recorded source revision, display version and monotonically increasing native build identifiers. Upload credentials SHALL be confined to protected release jobs. Nightly publication and pull requests SHALL NOT submit store builds. Retries SHALL inspect previous upload state and allocate a newer build identifier when required.

#### Scenario: Rebuild an already processed version

- **WHEN** a corrected binary is needed after its previous build identifier was consumed
- **THEN** the new upload retains the intended marketing version, uses a newer native identifier and records its exact source

#### Scenario: One CI run builds several platforms

- **WHEN** a Build apps workflow run produces sideload and selected store packages
- **THEN** all packages use the same native build identifier, derived from the retained workflow run counter, and build records identify the source revision and exact CI run URL

#### Scenario: Missing upload credentials

- **WHEN** a store-upload credential is unavailable
- **THEN** submission fails explicitly without falling back to development signing or blocking independently valid sideload publication

### Requirement: Distribution packages exclude development entry points

Stable sideload and store packages SHALL exclude test-host launch modes, external frontend/root/port overrides, fixture selection and destructive test reset controls. Development and conformance builds SHALL retain their documented capabilities behind explicit build configuration. Normal diagnostics SHALL remain bounded and redact private data.

#### Scenario: Launch a Release Mac with test options

- **WHEN** a Release package is launched with development host arguments or environment overrides
- **THEN** those options cannot replace its frontend, storage root, listener configuration or application lifecycle

### Requirement: Store packages satisfy platform boundaries

Store artifacts SHALL include platform distribution signatures, required metadata and declarations. The macOS store app SHALL operate inside App Sandbox; Android SHALL publish an App Bundle and validate native page-size compatibility. macOS direct downloads SHALL use Developer ID signing, hardened runtime and notarization when the production distribution identities are provisioned.

#### Scenario: Sandboxed Mac operation

- **WHEN** a user connects hardware, renders the frontend, records, restarts, imports or exports in the sandboxed store app
- **THEN** permitted operations succeed without broad filesystem exceptions or a second application runtime

#### Scenario: Direct Mac download

- **WHEN** a user downloads the production direct-distribution ZIP onto a clean supported Mac
- **THEN** signature and notarization validation succeed without requiring removal of quarantine attributes
