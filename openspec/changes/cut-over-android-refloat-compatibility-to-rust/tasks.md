## 1. Temporary Android compatibility bridge

- [x] 1.1 Add `refloat-compatibility-android-jni` to the locked workspace with the exact four-symbol ABI, fixed statuses, bounded primitive-array validation/publication, canonical safe-record delegation, shared JNI support, and panic containment.
- [x] 1.2 Add focused Rust bridge tests for exact INFO request/records, every safe failure mapping, layout admission, null/exception/reference/array/capacity/distinctness bounds, initialized outputs, and contained failures.

## 2. Android build and ownership integration

- [x] 2.1 Complete the shared compatibility bridge catalogue entry with exact Android package, library, JNI-prefix, and four-symbol metadata while preserving every Apple field and artifact unchanged.
- [x] 2.2 Add a ninth typed Android Gradle bridge entry, host and four-ABI Debug/Release tasks, generated JNI merge inputs, host-JVM property, and exact task/input/output audits.
- [x] 2.3 Extend root dependency, workspace-layout, exact-symbol, record-ownership, generated-artifact, source-selection, and Apple-isolation audits for the temporary bridge.
- [x] 2.4 Update Android/core ownership documentation to identify Rust as the selected INFO/catalogue/layout-admission owner and both compatibility bridges as planned deletions with the unified Rust runtime.

## 3. Kotlin adapter and production selection

- [x] 3.1 Add the narrow Kotlin JNI loader and strict canonical compatibility-record adapter while preserving existing normalized models and established protocol errors.
- [x] 3.2 Reuse the exact current-generation canonical dynamic-layout record for Rust admission and preserve reset, invalid-replacement, field-list publication, and realtime-selection behavior.
- [x] 3.3 Carry one accepted compatibility decision through protocol messages, controller discovery, control setup, supported-state publication, and tests without a Kotlin string catalogue lookup.
- [x] 3.4 Add focused host-JVM tests for exact requests and every INFO/profile/layout decision, ABI/status/record mapping, discovery/control propagation, reset/replacement, and exhaustive malformed-record rejection.
- [x] 3.5 Select Rust from Android production, delete superseded Kotlin INFO offsets, release catalogue/profile derivation, required identifiers, set admission, and every fallback, and prove higher-level ownership remains unchanged.

## 4. Software verification

- [x] 4.1 Run formatting, warnings-denied Rust tests/lints, focused host-JVM tests, dependency/symbol/source audits, and strict change validation.
- [x] 4.2 Run clean Android host and four-ABI Debug/Release packaging plus macOS, iOS simulator, and unsigned iOS device regression packaging.
- [x] 4.3 Run the complete `just verify` software gate after production selection and Kotlin algorithm deletion.

## 5. Physical regression and final gate

- [x] 5.1 Run focused identity, direct/CAN control, applicable BMS, dynamic/legacy telemetry, ride, unexpected-disconnect, and background/session scenarios on the connected Android device against the ESP32 fixture through production Rust compatibility decisions.
- [x] 5.2 Run the same applicable focused scenarios on the connected iOS device through its unchanged selected compatibility bridge.
- [x] 5.3 Run focused identity, direct/CAN control, applicable BMS, dynamic/legacy telemetry, ride, and unexpected-disconnect scenarios on the macOS host through its unchanged selected compatibility bridge.
- [x] 5.4 Record only bounded location-sample absence as deferred manual coverage; require every non-location assertion and cleanup to pass, then rerun focused checks, `just verify`, and strict OpenSpec validation in the final implementation state.

## Physical evidence

- Android device `1cfb7634120d7ece` and ESP32 `/dev/cu.usbmodem111401`: all 17 matrix scenarios passed across resumed runs after transient fixture `ADVERTISE_FAILED` setup errors. The background scenario passed BLE logging, session, lifecycle, and cleanup assertions; location was authorized/background-capable but produced no sample during the bounded 10-second dwell, so only sample persistence is deferred.
- iOS device `00008101-00195021268B001E`: focused `identity,direct-legacy,control-direct,control-can,bms-direct-controller,bms-express,bms-standalone,ride,unexpected-disconnect,background` passed. Background BLE/session behavior passed and location persisted two samples.
- macOS host: focused `identity,direct-legacy,control-direct,control-can,bms-direct-controller,bms-express,bms-standalone,ride,unexpected-disconnect` passed.
